WordsService provides the following words:

'angular'
'development'
'rendering'
'frontend'
'application'
'expression'
'closure'
'observable'
'array'
'code'
'return'

# Task 1

Display the data from WordsService like this:

<img src="https://github.com/webcrafters/ng-arrays-exercise/blob/master/sol1_1.png?raw=true" height="300">
<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/webcrafters/ng-arrays-exercise/blob/master/sol1_2.png?raw=true" height="300">

Letters are spread evenly across the viewport width.

One word per row.

Rows are spread evenly across the viewport height.

There should be no scrolling.

**You can expect that**

- the number of words will be not too high (all the words will fit into one viewport by height)
- the length of any word will not be too high (any word can fit into one viewport by width)

The screen may get crowded if there are many rows, but rows should naturally fit into the document flow, never overlapping.

# Task 2

Display the words like this:

<img src="https://github.com/webcrafters/ng-arrays-exercise/blob/master/sol2.png?raw=true" height="300">

Just like in task 1, expect that the rows will be few enough to fit into one page.

# Task 3

Display the words like this:

<img src="https://github.com/webcrafters/ng-arrays-exercise/blob/master/sol3.png?raw=true" height="300">

Just like in task 1, expect that the rows will be few enough to fit into one page.
# Task 4

Display the words like this: 

<img src="https://github.com/webcrafters/ng-arrays-exercise/blob/master/sol4.png?raw=true" height="300">

Similar to Task1, but **expect the number of words to be arbitrarily high**

The screen may get arbitrarily crowded, words may overlap. 

Make sure to have an exact even distribution of words across the viewport height.
